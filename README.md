## WIP

Overcomplicated POS but it does what it needs to do.
Bit generic because I had plans of integrating multiple providers but I'll see when I have time for that.

### Usage
```bash
$ rgpt-cli --mode <mode> <input>
```

E.g.
```bash
$ rgpt-cli --mode bash "generate a random number"
```bash
echo $((RANDOM % 100))
```
Execute?:
> None
> echo $((RANDOM % 100 + 1))
```

## TODO
- [ ] lots
